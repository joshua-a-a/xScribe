## Why Source-Available?

xScribe is privacy software. We believe you should be able to verify our claims, not just trust them.

By making our source code available to licensees, you can:
- Audit the code to confirm no data leaves your device
- Verify there are no hidden network connections
- Check that temporary files are properly deleted
- Satisfy your own compliance requirements

We have nothing to hide because there's nothing hidden.
